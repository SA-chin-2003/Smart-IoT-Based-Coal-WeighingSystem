# ðŸš† Smart IoT Railway Wagon Load Monitoring

An IoT-based project that helps detect **overloading/underloading** in railway wagons using weight sensors, microcontrollers, and real-time cloud monitoring.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement
To prevent cargo loss, fuel waste, and safety issues by using an IoT solution to measure wagon weight and send real-time alerts.

---

## ðŸ›  Hardware Used
- Load Sensor (HX711 + strain gauge)
- Arduino Uno / NodeMCU
- Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266)
- Battery Power Supply

---

## ðŸ§° Software Tools
- Arduino IDE
- HTML/CSS (Frontend)
- Cloud API (ThingSpeak / Firebase / Custom API)

---

## ðŸ“¶ Working
1. Sensor measures load weight.
2. Sends data to Arduino.
3. Arduino posts to cloud.
4. Webpage fetches real-time weight.

---


## ðŸ“Š Future Scope
- Add volume sensor
- SMS/Email alerts via IFTTT
- ML-based load optimization

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output
> Weight: 1234.56 kg (Wagon 001)
